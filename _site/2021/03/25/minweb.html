<h2 align="center">The only average that matters on the modern web</h2>

<p>Call it <em>bloat</em>, call it <em>inefficient</em>, call it whatever you want. It doesn’t matter <em>how</em> it is described, users instinctively understand what is wrong with the modern web. 
Luke Smith recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvDyQUpaFf4">excommunicated</a> recipe sites for taking up tens of megabytes of bandwidth for a single recipe - many of 
which contain relatively little text and image content - and Maciej Cegłowski’s <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">talk</a> on the subject is a real eye-opener.
There’s a few <em>average</em> figures about the web that are quite surprising: The median webpage size is <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight">over 2MB</a>, the average time
to a render webpage fully is over <a href="https://backlinko.com/page-speed-stats">10 seconds</a> on desktop and double that on mobile clients, unsurprisingly, the average connection 
speed worldwide was <a href="https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/report/q3-2015-soti-connectivity-final.pdf">~5Mbps</a> in 2015. What does this all culminate to? An 
averagely shitty experience accessing the modern web.</p>

<p>The <em>average</em> modern website is optimisied for the <em>average</em> user*<sub>1</sub>, this works in theory as internet speeds and mobile data packages increase in volume year-on-year*<sub>1</sub>. However, this
cuts off a specific kind of user, the user with slow internet, a minimal data package, or both of these things - this, as Dan Luu points out in his <a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat">article on web bloat</a>,
usually means people living in the developing world, however, real, factual, home-grown Americans <a href="https://1-minute-modem.branchable.com">deal with this issue</a> as well.</p>

<h2>Appendix/Footnotes:</h2>

<p>*<sub>1</sub> You will notice that I neglected to correct my own point here, the average <em>worldwide</em> user isn’t actually the one that web developers design their webpages for, no no, as you will find out, the target
audience of these bloated pages actually have far-above-average connection speeds which increase in speed year-on-year, covering up the issue.</p>

<p>*<sub>2</sub> If you live in the United Kingdom or keep up with it’s daily news, you might be aware of the UK government’s near-obsessive track record with broadband schemes, whether it’s the opposition’s idea of 
<a href="https://labour.org.uk/press/british-broadband-labour-sets-out-mission-to-connect-communities-across-britain-by-delivering-free-full-fibre-broadband-for-all/">free broadband (lulz)</a>, or the Conservatives’s belief 
that everyone should have the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50042720">fastest option possible</a> which, somehow, will deliver <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-benefits-of-broadband">untold economic growth</a>. 
I’m obviously not a proponent of the idea that everyone in the country should have gigabit internet - particularly because I think it is entirely unpractical - but I am in favour of increasing availability
and reliability of internet coverage in the UK. The median internet speed in the United Kingdom is <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/internet-connection-speed-by-country.php#median-internet-speeds-2020">28.51Mbps/8.87Mbps</a> 
(up/down), <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/telecoms-research/broadband-research/may-2020-uk-home-broadband-performance">less than 30%</a> of connected households have &lt;30Mbps, and 
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/telecoms-research/broadband-research/may-2020-uk-home-broadband-performance">20%</a> of the populace currently do not have a broadband connection. These stats are 
generally inline with <em>some</em> of Europe (I should note that whilst mean speeds are higher in much of Western Europe, median speeds paint a different picture) and, in terms of 
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/multi-sector-research/infrastructure-research/connected-nations-2018/interactive-report">coverage</a>, most regions have a high availability of broadband (without
regard for speed) - interestingly, the county I reside in has one of the worst coverage statistics in the country. It is important to mentioned these statistics moving forward as it
 may help to explain one potential reason that the modern internet is such a steaming heap.</p>

<p>Let’s take a surface-level dive into <a href="https://wiby.me/">Wiby</a>, a search engine that indexes <em>classic</em> web-pages, generally web pages that have a small <em>page weight</em> (the size of the website which, in turn, impacts its load speed),
minimal or zero javascript, and minimal use of “scripts/css for cosmetic effect”.</p>

<p>Web bloat is not <em>necessarily</em> a problem with webpages generally (although developers are also to blame for this foul mess but we will get to them shortly), rather this is a problem indicative of 
webpage indexing guidelines. For example: Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/overview">guidelines</a>
dictate the do’s and dont’s of the www, not a terrible idea given that much of this advice pertains to keeping malicious sites off their search results top spot but this has, with time, favoured a particular 
brand of web-devvery that puts the design of the web in the hands of marketing-types. Marketers have taken these guidelines to laughable new heights, where, up here, there are only two rules: <em>a)</em> 
Google needs to find your site and rank it highly by some arbitrary metric - that means adding hugely over-complicated landing pages and having blog posts on sites that don’t want or need them, and <em>b)</em> 
the noobs need to buy your shit*<sub>1</sub>. Somewhat absent is the idea that webpages should contain useful or interesting information that is easy to access and read.</p>
