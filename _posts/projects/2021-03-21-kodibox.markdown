<h3>Weapon of choice:</h3>

<h3>Adapted from:</h3>
Media Experience's <a href="https://mediaexperience.com/raspberry-pi-xbmc-with-raspbmc/">Guide</a> to LibreELEC & Kodi on RBP4.
<h3>Summary:</h3>

Like many UK-based taxpayers, I don't like or need the TV license. For years I have been connecting my old Macbook to the television and using the 
contemporary streaming solutions - Netflix and the like (I don't *think* I need to discuss why these streaming services are terrible for the consumer\*<sub>1</sub>)
I decided to replace this solution with something a little smaller and more energy efficient: A Raspberry Pi (RBP from now on) running the popular open-source *Kodi* 
software and LibreELEC operating system. This isn't *much* of a project but I thought it would be useful to share a more condensed guide than the one linked above with
 some extra pieces of information I gained along the way...

Here's how to build a small media center for less than £200*:

<h3> Parts List: </h3>

1. A Raspberry Pi 3/4.
2. A RBP power-supply (~5V, 3A).
3. A micro-SD card.
4. A micro-HDMI to HDMI cable (or an adapter & HDMI cable). 
5. An on/off USB-C switch (optional).
6. A RBP case (optional).
7. An external HDD or SSD (optional).

<h3> How do? </h3>

1. Build the case and fit the RBP, this part *should* be fairly obvious if you have a good quality case. 
2. 
2. If you're opting to use Kodi for media files (e.g. DVD rips), an external hard drive can be loaded up and connected to the RBP Kodi box. Ensure the 
drive is formatted to NTFS or ext4 or it won't be usable with the RBP.
3. 

4. If you're planning on using WiFi with the RBP (e.g. for the Kodi remote app), mess with your router to stop the RBP from occupying the 5GHz band - the
wifi on the RBP is terrible enough without the reduced range/penetration.\*<sub>3</sub>


<h3> Appendix: </h3>
\*<sub>1</sub> There's an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/02/19/what-is-the-netflix-effect/?sh=ca883e56409b) in Forbes about how Netflix is bound to destroy traditional TV and cinema
because it's giving consumers what they want, and what do they want? Supposedly they want *"products that are easy to use and tailored to match their preferences"*, which, I suppose, is true but that description
certainly doesn't suit Netflix in its current state. If you've never had the pleasure, Netflix is easy to use if, and only if, you're open to consuming specific programming without much thought. It's a bundle of
 both popular releases and in-house, barely passable movies and series that are selectively added and removed at will with little warning given to the user. Owing more to the *Spotify effect* than anything else,
it also lacks any real form of useful user recommendations other than giving you more of the same thing and plastering the service with its own releases as often as possible.
There are other [services](https://mubi.com/) that offer a more movie-centric approach with an *real* selection process. It is also difficult and, I would argue, unreasonable, to ignore the point that the typical
 consumer *should* really **care** *how* they spend their money when it comes to media, in order to decide who they give their money to, rather than pay for the convenient approach and allow Netflix to decide how to
 split the pot.

\*<sub>2</sub> This is a guide price that assumes an external drive is being used. I opted for a 5TB HDD which pushed the cost of this project up to ~£165. 

\*<sub>3</sub> I had some issues with audio playback via the micro-HDMI output, this can be resolved by tunneling into the RBP and adding `hdmi_drive=2` to the 
`/flash/config.txt` file. More information on this can be found [here](https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread/20621-no-audio-on-hdmi-from-new-pi4b-a-common-prob-it-seems/). Additionally, one of the micro-HDMI ports
doesn't support audio playback, I guess.

\*<sub>4</sub> In fact, the WiFi on RBP4 is such a joke - with issues ranging from WPA authentication, to the 5GHz band, to screen resolution in [more](https://twitter.com/assortedhackery/status/1200056633898029061)
than one [case](https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread/21096-rpi4-can-t-use-wifi-network-error-input-output-eror/) - I would just recommend not using it if possible. I'm using the Kodibox as a glorified, offline, media center so 
this is not really an issue in my case.
