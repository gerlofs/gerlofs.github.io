# A list of other websites you should visit:

1. Neil Panchal's [site](https://neil.computer/) is one of the main inspirations for the *simplicity-first* theme of this website's re-design. His blog posts are also very interesting.
2. [Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/) runs, potentially, my favourite science & engineering blog.
3. [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/) and the more recent [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) are quintessential reading material.
