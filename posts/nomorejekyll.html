<p>Jekyll is a static site generation tool that solves an easily solvable problem, it gobbles up markdown (.MD) files and spews forth HTML files which can be viewed within the browser. I understand that Jekyll is not the only <em>static site generator</em> tool, nor is its only use turning markdown into HTML - there is an optimisation process, a more complex build layer, inclusion of the <em>Liquid</em> templating language, among other things I&#39;m sure... However, this is all that <strong>I</strong> happen to use Jekyll for, a very simple mechanic of converting my markdown format posts into readable webpages with the correct stylesheet tacked-on.</p>
<p>I, at one point, ran my blog using Jekyll, hosted via Github, but have come to realise that the program I use to write up my posts - <a href='https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/typora/'>Typora</a> - already solves half of my problem for me. It can export markdown files to HTML without styling. Do you see where I&#39;m going with this? An hour-or-so and a hundred-or-so lines of Python later, the posts on my blog are now converted by Typora and inserted into a standard HTML template, with a seperate <em>main</em> and <em>post</em> stylesheet, copied across to a new static file ready to be hosted on the site. </p>

<p>See you later, Jekyll. </p>
